# firstwebsideofdunc

A personal website project demonstrating my journey in web development.
This project represents my first venture into web development, initiated on June 2, 2022. What started as a simple "Hello World" has evolved into a fully featured personal website that showcases my growth as a developer.

## Development History

### Pre v0.5

I developed all the code and site from scratch, without using templates or borrowed code. This includes all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementations.

Starting from version 0.5, the project began incorporating external libraries to enhance functionality and design.
